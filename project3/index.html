<h2>About</h2>

<p>An alternative rock band founded in 1998 in Toronto, Ontario
	consists of Emily Haines, James Shaw, Joshua Winstead and Joules Scott-Key.
	Their electronic, new wave style has a fresh and yet almost classic feel.</p>
	
<p>Metric couldn’t care less about the zeitgeist. 
	Here we are in 2021—when rock bands are supposed to be a thing of the past 
	and the future as we imagined it is disintegrating before our eyes—and 
	suddenly there’s this rock band from Toronto sounding vibrant as can be, 
	blasting through songs and proclaiming that now is not the time to retreat; 
	we’ve got to come out of hiding and live our lives despite the doubts that plague us.</p>
